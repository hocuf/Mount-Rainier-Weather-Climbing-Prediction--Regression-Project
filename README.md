# Mount Rainier Weather Climbing Prediction Regression Project


A year ago i had the opportunity to Climb this beautiful Mountain. Its a 15000 feet majestic beast looking just stands out from Seattle Washington. I was lucky enough to be part of a a great team to be able to successfully reach the summit. The weather was perfect the day we climbed. More often Weather plays a major role in deciding the summit success. Here is an attempt to use the historical weather data and the climbing records to analyse and predict the summit success given the weather details on a given day.
